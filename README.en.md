## Overview

ZCode Switcher saves and manages multiple ZCode accounts locally. It supports quota display, seamless account switching without restarting ZCode, and low-quota auto switching based on a selectable model.

All account profiles are stored on your own computer and are not uploaded to any third-party server.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Local account management | Save, rename, delete, and batch-delete multiple accounts |
| JSON import/export | Back up and migrate account profiles |
| Seamless switching | Switch accounts without restarting ZCode; config changes take effect immediately |
| Quota display | Show quota, subscription status, and refresh results |
| Low-quota auto switching | Pick the model to judge by (defaults to GLM-5.3 Flash); when its quota is below the threshold, switch to the account with more remaining |
| Capsule floating window | Show account pool quota for the selected model and support resizing |
| Scheduled refresh | Refresh quota by minute and keep the latest quota data after closing the app |
| Multi-language UI | Supports Chinese, English, and Russian |
| In-app updates | Check for new versions, view release notes, download, and install updates in the app |

## Download

Download the installer for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/git-l-1031/zcode-switcher/releases):

- Windows x64: `ZCode.Switcher_x.x.x_x64-setup.exe`
- macOS Apple Silicon beta: `ZCode.Switcher_x.x.x_aarch64.dmg`

The macOS build is not yet notarized with an Apple Developer ID. On first launch, you may need to allow it in System Settings → Privacy & Security.

## Usage Flow

1. First, log in to ZCode with an account as usual. You can also use [Zcode-register](https://github.com/sui-bian-ovo/Zcode-register) to automatically register and log in to the ZCode client.
2. Open ZCode Switcher, click the “Refresh” button, and then click “Save Current Account” to save your current login status to the local account database.
3. To add more accounts, switch accounts in ZCode first, use OAuth login in the tool, or import a JSON / ZIP backup file.
4. Saved accounts will show nickname, subscription expiration date, quota progress bars, and refresh status in the list.
5. After enabling seamless switching, click the switch button on an account card to switch accounts. The switch does not require restarting ZCode, and the account config takes effect immediately.
6. Enable low-quota auto switching and pick the model to judge by in Settings (defaults to GLM-5.3 Flash). When the current account's quota for that model is below the threshold, the app automatically switches to an account with more remaining quota.
7. If you want account pool status to stay visible, enable capsule floating mode and place the quota stats in a desktop corner.
